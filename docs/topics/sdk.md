# SDK

# ![](/docs/img/warning.png) NOTE

- __IMPORTANT__ A user _must be logged in via main client_ for most of the SDK to work
- Many functions in `Ruyi.SDK.BrainCloudApi` namespace don't yet work
	- Generally speaking, only those in `RuyiNet` work
    - This is not the fault of [brainCloud](http://getbraincloud.com/), it is intentionally and temporarily done by us
