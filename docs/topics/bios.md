# BIOS

Similar to other devices, the console has BIOS firmware.

Recent versions of the devkit as well as the retail console are pre-installed with the latest BIOS/OS.  The latest BIOS is also available from [release downloads](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases).  Older versions are available from the old dev portal and on request.

This document will be removed in the future.

## Version

__Checking BIOS version of Running Machine__

- In Ruyi client
    1. Go to __Settings > System > System Information__
    1. Check versions
    ![](/docs/img/version.png)

OR

- In Windows
    1. Run `msinfo32.exe`
    1. Inspect __System Summary -> BIOS Version/Date__ value  
    ![](/docs/img/msinfo32_bios.png)

__Checking Version of BIOS Archive__

If archive is named `DA220013.zip` then it is version __0.13__.

You can verify version number in `DA220REL.txt` file:
```
*   [Version]:
*   BIOS Version:  DA220013.rom (V0.13)
```

__Important__:  

![](/docs/img/warning.png) Because the BIOS must be paired with a compatible AMD driver, the BIOS version __must__ be paried with the correct version of [the OS](os.md).  This is summarized as follows:  

| BIOS Version | Ruyi OS Version | AMD Driver Stack Version/Date
|-|-|-
| [1.03](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases/download/0.9.2.3270/DA220103.zip) | 1.07+ | 1.0.5.0 2018/9/14
| [1.02](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases/download/v0.9.0.2440/BIOS_DA220102.zip) | 1.04/1.05 | 1.0.4.0 2018/7/10
| [1.01](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases/download/v0.9.0.2440/BIOS_DA220101.zip) | 1.02 | 1.0.1.0 2018/5/31
| [1.00](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases/download/legacy/DA220100.zip) | 1.02 | 1.0.1.0 2018/5/31

| 0.19 | 0.10 | 1.0.1.0 2018/4/17
| [0.15](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases/download/legacy/DA220015.zip) | 0.6 | 0.0.9.0 2018/3/12
| 0.13 | 0.6 | 0.0.9.0 2018/2/2
| 0.11 | 0.5 | 0.0.7.4 2018/1/5     
| 0.10 | 0.4 | 0.0.7.4 2018/1/5
| 0.09 | 0.3 | 0.0.7.2 2017/12/15
| 0.08 | 0.3 | 0.0.7.2 2017/12/15

Because the BIOS flashing process was changed, please follow the steps below:

Skipping steps may cause failure

| Current BIOS | Rule
|-|-|-
1.00+ | __Winflash__: Update to target version directly
|0.15-0.20 | __Winflash__: First update to __1.00__; and then update to the latest BIOS/OS.<br/>
| 0.09-0.13 |  __Winflash__: First update to __1.00__ (Machine will freeze for a few minutes, please wait.);  and then update to more recent BIOS/OS.

## Flashing the BIOS

Make sure you backed up data you need before flash from Windows OS since RuyiOS will be unbootable and you have to restore OS afterwards.

1. Download the [latest BIOS zip file](https://github.com/subor/sdk/releases)
1. Extract the zip file and locate `Winflash/` folder
1. Run `DA22XXXX.exe` to flash BIOS

## Installing Ruyi OS

![](/docs/img/warning.png) Flash the correct BIOS version __before__ installing the corresponding OS version.

See [Ruyi OS installation instructions](os.md#Installation).
