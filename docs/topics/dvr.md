# DVR

![](/docs/img/warning.png) This feature is not ready yet.

The [overlay](overlay.md) includes functionality to record video in-app.

Thanks to support for AMD's UVD/VCE (VCN) in [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), encoding with h.264/AVC, h.265/HEVC, VP8 or VP9 can be done up to 4K@60fps for almost no cost.
